= Introduction =

ElasticSearch is an easy to use and very scalable search engine. The OGR2ElasticSearch project is intended to allow the conversion from any of the supported <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr_formats.html">OGR</a> formats to an ElasticSearch index or cluster.

For a full list of OGR formats, please click here: http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr_formats.html

This is just the beginning but I intend to eventually store the data so that it can be retrieved as GeoJSON for use in most modern mapping applications.

= Getting Started =

1.  Check out the source code <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ogr2elasticsearch/source/checkout">here</a>

  * These sources will give you the files needed to add a new driver to build against the latest version of GDAL. 

2. The files you need are located in their respective directories. Start at GDAL root directory and add the following
 * ogr
       * ogrsf_frmts
            * GNUmakefile
            * makefile.vc
            * ogrsf_fmts.h
            * elastic
                 * GNUmakefile
                 * makefile.vc
                 * ogr_elastic.h
                 * ogrelasticdatasource.cpp
                 * ogrelasticdriver.cpp
                 * ogrelasticlayer.cpp
            * generic
                * GNUmakefile
                * makefile.vc
                * ogr_attrind.cpp
                * ogr_gensql.h
                * ogr_gensql.cpp
                * ogr_miattrind.cpp
                * ogrlayer.cpp
                * ogrregisterall.cpp
                * ogrsfdriver.cpp
                * ogrfdriverregistrar.cpp

3. Now that the files are in the right place, <a href="http://www.adamestrada.net/2011/08/22/how-to-build-gdal/">click here</a> for instructions on how to build GDAL.<br/>
4.  *Note:* the only dependency is libcurl.
